## 解题思路

1. if student likes this sandwich, shift this student and this sandwich

2. if student doesn't like this sandwich, shift this student and push him back in the array

3. if student doesn't match any sandwich number, return students length

## 代码

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} students
 * @param {number[]} sandwiches
 * @return {number}
 * 1. if student likes this sandwich, shift this student and this sandwich
 * 2. if student doesn't like this sandwich, shift this student and push him back in the array
 * 3. if student doesn't match any sandwich number, return students length
 */
var countStudents = function(students, sandwiches) {
    while(true){
        let sandwich = sandwiches[0];
        let student = students[0];
        if(!students.includes(sandwich)){
            return students.length;
        }
        if(student==sandwich){
            students.shift();
            sandwiches.shift();
        }else{
            students.shift();
            students.push(student);
        };
    }
};
